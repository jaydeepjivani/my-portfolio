Hi,

From the job description, I understand the essential technical requirement of WordPress Developer, and I feel very confident as I have extensive experience with PHP, WordPress,
Laravel, Codeigniter, Angular & React Native development. I can handle complexity with quality of work and on-time delivery.

Over six years of extensive experience in development, I have spent my valuable three to four years in WordPress Developments.

Here are some of my RECENTLY Developed Creations:

However, I am looking for a long-term opportunity as a Full Stack developer; hence I can do whatever work and anytime to complete the project. Also, I am available to kick start
the work on an immediate basis.

About the working hours -
If sufficient work in the queue for me, I can work full time based 40+ hours per week. In case of urgency, I would like to engage for additional hours on request.

I am looking forward to start interview so we can discuss about the project and start it.

Thank you
Jaydeep
